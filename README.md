Here you can find my EEE4113F Design Project files

The project involved building and testing an Intelligent Sensor Network using an ESP32 CAM module, PIR sensor to implement a wakeup system for the camera to reduce power consumption, and a DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor for ambient environmental conditions.

Once the PIR sensor detects activity, the camera wakes up and captures images, simultaneously, ambient temperature and humidity readings are taken and this data is stored on an sd card.
